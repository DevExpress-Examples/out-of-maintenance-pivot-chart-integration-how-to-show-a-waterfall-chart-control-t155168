# Pivot Chart Integration - How to show a waterfall chart control


<p>This example demonstrates how to represent the pivot grid data as a waterfall chart. The XtraCharts control does not support this series view by default, however, it is possible to achieve the required result by using the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraCharts/CustomDocument2985">Range Bar Series View</a>. To customize point values, create an intermediate data source that contains all required data and bind it to ChartControl. Please refer to the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraChartsChartControl_DataSourcetopic">ChartControl.DataSource Property</a>  help topic for additional information about the Chart data binding.<br /><br />This example was created based on the previous <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E3572">OBSOLETE - Pivot Chart Integration - How to show a waterfall chart control</a> one.</p>
